 *   APIFY_TOKEN      — for the Apify run-sync-get-dataset-items endpoint

 *   - apify/twitter-scraper           (X / Twitter, public timelines + profile)
 *   - apify/instagram-profile-scraper (Instagram public profiles)
 *
 * If everything fails we surface the raw error so the UI can fall back to

/**
 * Deep LinkedIn scrape. Per Jack: "the linkedin scrape isnt deep enough."
 *
 * Strategy changes (May 2026):
 *  - DEFAULT premium=true. ScrapingDog's premium tier returns the FULL
 *    profile JSON (vs. a thin meta payload on the free tier) — recent
 *    activity, full experience descriptions, certifications, awards,
 *    volunteer history, projects, publications. The credit cost is ~5x
 *    but the data is ~10x. Without premium, the scrape would fall back
 *    to a one-line headline and we'd lose every signal that makes the
 *    twin's opener actually personal. If premium fails (rare 5xx), we
 *    fall through to a non-premium retry as a safety net.
 *  - Lifted EVERY artificial cap:
 *      about         1,500 → 6,000 chars
 *      experience    6 entries → 20, per-role desc 240 → 2,000 chars
 *      education     4 → 10
 *      skills        10 → 60
 *  - Pull every field LinkedIn surfaces and ScrapingDog returns:
 *      certifications, courses, languages, honors_and_awards, projects,
 *      publications, organizations, volunteer_experience, recommendations,
 *      activities (recent posts), articles, featured items.
 *    These are the "what is this person actually doing right now /
 *    what are they proud of" signals — exactly what the opener needs
 *    to feel like the inviter actually read the profile.

 *
 * The new order:
 *   - Social URL → Apify multi-actor chain only. If all actors fail,
 *     throw (don't silently return the Exa title).
 *   - Non-social URL (LinkedIn public posts, blogs, Substack, Crunchbase) →
