 * Twin tools — the action surface that makes /twin a real agentic
 * chat instead of a draft-only thinking partner. Two categories:
 *
 * READ tools (run server-side, results fed back into the model loop):
 *   - list_pending_proposals
 *   - list_recent_conversations
 *   - search_platform_users
 *
 * WRITE tools (model "executes" them in the loop, but they DON'T touch
 * the DB. Instead each returns a structured pending_action object that
 * the client renders as an inline ActionCard with an Approve button.
 * The user's tap is what triggers the real DB write via
 * /api/twin/execute-action — so the model can never write to the DB
 * without an explicit human confirmation):
 *   - update_proposal_text
 *   - accept_proposal
 *   - deny_proposal
 *   - send_message_to_conversation
