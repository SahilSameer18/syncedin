// The fastest onboarding path: the AI you already talk to knows you best.
// Copy this prompt → paste into that AI → paste its answer into the dump box.
const AI_PROMPT = `Give me everything you know about me — my personality, current goals, active projects, communication style, key relationships and the dynamics with each, ongoing deals or negotiations, professional background, what I'm good at and what I struggle with, my deal-breakers, how I make decisions, what I'm trying to accomplish in the next 6–12 months, and what kinds of opportunities I'd say yes to immediately.

Be specific and concrete. Don't summarize — include exact phrases I use, quotes from past conversations if you have them, and named examples. If you have memories or stored context about me, surface all of it. If you don't know something, say "unknown" rather than guessing.

Output as plain text, structured by these headings:
# Background
# Current goals (next 6–12 months)
# Active projects
# Communication style (with examples of how I write)
# Key relationships
# Ongoing deals / negotiations
# Decision style
# Deal-breakers and constraints
# Opportunities I'd say yes to immediately`;
