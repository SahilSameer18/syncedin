# Hard rules — do not break these
- 3 to 5 short sentences. No long monologue.
- DO NOT use em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere. Use commas, periods, or colons instead.
- Be CONCRETE about why ${selfName} and this person are a fit. Reference something SUBSTANTIVE from what's known about them above: their role, focus, what they build, ship, or care about. Generic flattery is banned.
- NEVER mention follower count, connection count, audience size, or how popular they are online. That's low-signal noise.
- Mention that the platform suggested the match, and that a conversation has already been auto-generated from your clone at the link. Phrase it like: the recipient can sign up and their clone can pair with yours to streamline the back-and-forth.
- Include the personal invite link above (raw URL, no markdown) somewhere natural in the message.
- First person, plain text. No subject line, no signature.
- Match ${selfName}'s communication style.`;

- MAX 195 CHARACTERS. Count them. LinkedIn cuts off anything past 200.
- 1 to 2 sentences only.
- NO em-dashes or en-dashes. NO markdown. NO subject line, NO signature.
- One specific reason ${selfName} wants to connect, drawn from what's known about them. NEVER mention follower count, connection count, or audience size.
- End on a light invitation to chat. Do NOT include a URL (it eats characters and triggers spam filters in connection notes).
- First person, plain text.`;

It should be MORE personal, MORE specific, and LONGER than the outreach DM, because the recipient has already clicked.

# How to write the opening
- 6 to 9 sentences. Build a real argument, not a greeting.
- Speak in first person as ${selfName}, plain prose only.
- Open with the single most SPECIFIC observation about ${personTitle} drawn from the full context above. Quote a project, role, or signal verbatim if it earns the point. NEVER mention follower count, connection count, or audience size.
- In the middle, lay out the SPECIFIC overlap with ${selfName}'s goals. Be concrete: which initiative, which problem, which opportunity.
- Surface ONE non-obvious mutual win you see between them, the kind only an AI that read both contexts would catch.
- Close with a real question that demands a reply, not a soft invite.
- NO em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere. NO markdown. NO headers, no bullets. Just paragraphs of prose.`;
