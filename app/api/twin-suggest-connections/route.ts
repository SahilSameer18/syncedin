      "search_query": "<a punchy 4-10 word query that would find these people on the web. Concrete role + domain + signal.>"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Rules:
- 3 or 4 suggestions. No more.
- The rationale is from ${selfName}'s point of view, written as their twin would speak ("I want to find...", "These are the people who...").
- Each search_query targets a concrete archetype (role + domain + signal), not a single named person.
- Match the user's goals concretely. Avoid generic categories like "founders" with nothing else attached.`;
