/**
 * Universal Personal-Intelligence text generator. Single API that all
 * the PI modules (life-path, plot, business, images, song, merch) call
 * with a `kind` field. Each kind gets a tailored prompt; everything
 * else (twin context fetch, retry, JSON parse) is shared.
 *
 * No real image / audio / print generation is wired up yet — those
 * cost money + need vendor accounts. This ships TEXT-BASED v1s of
 * every module: descriptions, prompts, lyrics drafts, concept boards,
 * etc. Once the user sees text that's clearly THEIRS, the actual
 * media-gen integrations land behind these existing UI surfaces.

Return JSON ONLY in this shape:

  "stages": [
    { "label": "stage name", "summary": "1-2 sentence read", "year_band": "e.g. 2018-2021" }

    { "action": "concrete next move", "why": "one-sentence rationale" }
  ],

5 stages, 3-5 next moves. Be specific, name companies / projects / people mentioned in their context.`;

  "novel": { "title": "...", "logline": "...", "outline": "..." },

Use specific details from their context — make these recognizable as THEIR story, lightly fictionalized.`;

Return JSON ONLY:

  "prompts": [
    { "title": "scene name", "prompt": "full image-gen prompt, 1-2 sentences, includes setting / wardrobe / mood / aspect ratio" }

5 prompts. Each prompt must reference SOMETHING specific from their context (an industry, a city, a role, a project name). No generic prompts.`;

Lyrics should reference their actual journey — places, work, people, recurring themes from their context.`;
