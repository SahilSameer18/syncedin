 * Permanent account deletion endpoint. Cascade:
 *   1. Delete the user's twin_profile row.
 *   2. Delete any pending_invites they created.
 *   3. Delete invites where they were the recipient (best-effort; if
 *      the column doesn't exist on older deployments, skip).
 *   4. Delete their notification_preferences.
 *   5. Delete their conference_members + community memberships.
 *   6. NULL out their participation in conversations they were a
 *      participant in (keeps the conversation visible to the other
 *      side without breaking it). Doesn't touch messages directly.
 *   7. Delete the auth.users row via service-role admin API.
 *
 * Every step is wrapped in try/catch — partial failure should still
 * complete as much as possible rather than leaving the account half-
 * deleted. The auth.users delete at the end will fail visibly to the
 * client only if the entire cascade gave up.
