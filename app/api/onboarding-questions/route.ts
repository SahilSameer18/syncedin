/**
 * Goal-aware onboarding question generator.
 *
 * Jack: "when someone puts their goals in, maybe we should custom
 * generate the questions we ask based on that specific goal." Instead
 * of one static "what's your number 1 goal?" follow-up, this route
 * takes the user's goal text + (optionally) an intent tile they
 * clicked on the landing (cofounder / investors / advisors / idea)
 * and returns 3-5 tailored follow-up questions Claude designed to
 * sharpen their twin's matchability fast.
 *
 * Input  → POST { goal: string, intent?: "cofounder"|"investors"|"advisors"|"idea"|"" }
 * Output → { questions: Array<{ id, prompt, placeholder?, kind }> }
 *
 * Schema-safe: if anthropic call fails for any reason, returns a
 * static fallback set so onboarding never blocks on a network blip.

You receive the user's freeform goal statement and (optionally) an intent label they picked. Return 3 to 5 follow-up questions that, ANSWERED, would let an AI agent representing this person quickly determine fit with any potential counterpart.

GUIDELINES:
- Questions must be SPECIFIC to their stated goal, not generic ("what are your strengths?" is bad).
- Avoid yes/no questions. Each question should pull out a concrete data point: a number, a timeline, a name, a constraint.
- Mix one-line "short" answers with paragraph "long" answers. Bias toward short for facts (stage, amount, geography) and long for things requiring judgment (ideal counterpart, dealbreaker, success picture).
- Surface dealbreakers — at least one question should flush out what would make a match WRONG.
- Tone: conversational, direct, no buzzwords ("synergies", "leverage", "growth hacking" → no).
