/**
 * Generate draft answers for the Refine step questions based on whatever
 * the user has already given us (goals + ai_export_blob + name + city).
 *
 * The user can then accept/edit each draft instead of staring at three
 * blank textareas. Aim for high-signal one-paragraph answers that read
 * like the user could have written them.
 *
 * The Refine fields target useful conversation seeds — not generic
 * networking small talk. We want answers that help two twins surface
 * win-wins faster:
 *   - asks         : what the user concretely wants from the network now
 *   - offers       : what they can give in return / what they're known for
 *   - non_negotiables: deal-breakers the twin should enforce
 *
 * Returns JSON: { asks, offers, non_negotiables, communication_style }.
 * The wizard maps these to the existing fields:
 *   asks            → goals (already filled, used only for cross-ref)
 *   offers          → deal_preferences  (what makes you say YES)
 *   communication_style → communication_style
 *   non_negotiables → deal_breakers

Output STRICT JSON:
{
  "deal_preferences": "<2-3 sentences. The kinds of opportunities / people / conversations they'd say YES to instantly. Concrete patterns drawn from their goals or background. No vague filler.>",
  "communication_style": "<2-3 sentences. How they want to be approached, talked to, pushed back on. Length, tone, formality. If their goals mention building/shipping, lean direct. If they mention investing or strategy, lean considered.>",
  "deal_breakers": "<2-3 sentences. What makes them disengage. Specific behaviors, not abstract values. Pull from any signals in their background; if none, default to common-sense filters for their stated role.>"

Rules:
- First person, casual, 2-3 sentences each.
- NO em-dashes, NO markdown, NO emojis, NO hashtags.
- NEVER reference follower counts or audience size.
- If their existing draft for a field is non-empty, REFINE it rather than discard — keep their voice.
- Return ONLY the JSON, nothing else.`;
