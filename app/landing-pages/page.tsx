/**
 * /landing-pages — directory of every custom landing surface we've
 * shipped, so Jack can find them all in one place.
 *
 * Jack: "I think we made a page, a landing page just for onboarding
 * co-founders. I know we've made different custom landing pages.
 * Maybe it would be good to have a page of these pages somewhere
 * that I can find easier."
 *
 * Each card carries: title, audience, URL, one-line purpose, and a
 * copy-link button. Grouped by category. Static list — these pages
 * are explicit routes in the codebase, not data-driven, so editing
 * this file is the source of truth.
 *
 * Lives in AppShell so the nav + clone-sync card render. Authed-only
 * (most users don't need to discover these; this is an admin/operator
 * surface).
